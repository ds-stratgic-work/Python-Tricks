## Project Introduction
Python's perceived slowness is a sentiment that is often heard in conversations about programming languages, but it tends to overshadow the many strengths that Python possesses.
In reality, Python can be fast if it is written in a Pythonic manner. The devil lies in the details. Seasoned Python developers have a range of clever techniques at their 
disposal that can greatly enhance the performance of their code. Although these techniques may appear insignificant at first, they can actually result in significant improvements
in efficiency. Let's explore nine of these approaches that can revolutionize the way you write and optimize Python code.

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
